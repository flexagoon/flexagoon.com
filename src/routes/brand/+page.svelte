<h1>Brand Guidelines</h1>
<h2>Nickname</h2>
<p>
	My nickname is <b>flexagoon</b>, written exactly like that. You cannot change any letters or
	capitalize them in a different way. First letter <b>should not</b> be capitalized, even if in the beginning
	of the sentence.
</p>
<p>
	When using the name alone without any context, you <b>can</b> also add a period after it, as seen on
	the main page of this website and in the header.

<h2>Font</h2>
<p>
	This is not a hard requirement, however, my name should preferrably be written in the <a
		href="https://rsms.me/inter">Inter</a
	>
	font. More specifically, you should use the <b>Extra Bold Italic</b> variant.
</p>
<h2>Logo</h2>
<p>You can download my logo in three variants here. All three variants are in the SVG format.</p>
<p>
	🔴 <a href="/images/logo-color.svg">Colored variant</a><br />
	⚪ <a href="/images/logo-white.svg">White variant</a><br />
	⚫ <a href="/images/logo-black.svg">Black variant</a>
</p>
<p>
	The white and black variants can be of course recolored to a different color with any vector
	graphics editing program.
