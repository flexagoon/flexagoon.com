# Nickname

My nickname is **flexagoon**, written exactly like that. You cannot change any letters or capitalize them in a different way. First letter **should not** be capitalized, even if in the beginning of the sentence.

When using the name alone without any context, you **can** also add a period after it, as seen on the main page of this website and in the header.

# Font

This is not a hard requirement, however, my name should preferrably be written in the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) font. More specifically, you should use the **Extra Bold Italic** variant.

# Logo

You can download my logo in three variants here. All three variants are in the SVG format.

:red_circle: [Colored variant](/images/logo-color.svg)  
:white_circle: [White variant](/images/logo-white.svg)  
:black_circle: [Black variant](/images/logo-black.svg)

The white and black variants can be of course recolored to a different color with any vector graphics editing program.
