# Nickname

My nickname is **flexagoon**, written exactly like that. You cannot change any letters or capitalize them in a different way. First letter **should not** be capitalized, even if in the beginning of the sentence.

When using the name alone without any context, you **can** also add a period after it, as seen on the main page of this website and in the header.

# Font

This is not a hard requirement, however, my name should preferrably be written in the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) font. More specifically, you should use the **Extra Bold Italic** variant.

# Logo

My logo is available in two versions - colored and white. I'm currently in the process of improving the quality of it. When I finish it, you'll be able to download it from this page.
